<p>This is a graph of crashes sorted by amount of damage then grouped by whether there was an injury or a tow or whether there was
no injury and a drive away.  This combination of variables gave us our highest r2 value.  In this graph we can see that crashes when
there was an injury or a tow away were less in number but were almost uniformly over $1,500 in damage.  This makes sense because if there
is a tow away there would have to be extensive damage done to the car.  But what we see in the grouping where there was no injury or tow
away is that the majority of those crashes cost over $1,500.  The fact that even if there is not a car towed, that drivers had to pay over
$1,500 reveals how expensive driving can be and that it costs a lot of money to get in accidents of all kinds.</p>
