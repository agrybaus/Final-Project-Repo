<p>This graph takes a look at the hour at which each of these crashes took place.  0 represents Midnight  through the 24 hour day.
There is clearly a peaking of the crashes during evening rush hour.  From this data it would seem that crashes increase throughout
the day with that peak happening in the 7 O'clock hour.  This graph also tells us that the overnight hours of midnight through 
six AM have the least amount of crashes.  These hours would seemingly have the least amount of traffic, so it makes sense that these
would have the least amount of crashes.</p>
