<p>My intitial hypothesis was that weather conditions would impact crashes that 
    included injuries. I tested the weather conditions from our data (clear, rain, snow, etc) against 
    crashes that included injuries, as well as crashes without injuries. After running both tests, I 
    found that weather conditions with either crash type did not provide a statistically significant r2. 
    Both graphs show that these variables (weather condition and crash type) do not have a linear relationship
    and therefore do not provide any indication of whether a crash will happen, or if it will have injuries.</p>
